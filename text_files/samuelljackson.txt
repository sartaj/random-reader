You shut your face! If we want to hear you talk, I will shove my arm up your ass and work your mouth like a puppet.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now we took an oath, that I’m breaking now. We said we’d say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn’t. Nature is lethal but it doesn’t hold a candle to man.

Everybody knows, when you make an assumption, you make an ass out of you and umption.

Ain’t that always the way? Elevator music, a nigga with a kilt, and a chick with a nickel-plated nine?

Enough is enough! I’ve had it with these motherfuckin’ snakes on this motherfuckin plane!

Yeah, Zeus! As in, father of Apollo? Mount Olympus? Don’t fuckk with me or I’ll shove a lightning bolt up your ass!

AK-47, the very best there is. When you absolutely, positively got to kill every motherfucker in the room, accept no substitutes.

Yes, they deserve to die, and I hope they burn in hell!

You know me. It’s my duty to please that booty.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother’s keeper, and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Do you see any teletubbies in here?

And when muthafuckas get scared, that's when muthafuckas get shot.
